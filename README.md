# Fluid Mechanics - Reynolds Number Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository documents an experimental study on the Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity used to characterize fluid flow regimes. The project explores the transition between laminar and turbulent flow using water and cylindrical apertures of varying diameters.

## Contents
- **`Observation Table.xlsx`**: Contains raw experimental data, observations, and detailed calculations.
- **`REPORT.pdf`**: Comprehensive documentation covering objectives, theory, methodology, results, graphs, and conclusions.

## Objectives
1. Investigate the behavior of water flow through apertures of varying diameters.
2. Identify and analyze the transition points between laminar and turbulent flow regimes.
3. Calculate the Reynolds number for each flow regime using experimental data.

## Theory
The Reynolds number \(Re\) is a critical parameter in fluid dynamics, defined as:

Re = $\frac{v \cdot l \cdot \rho}{\mu}$

Where:  
- $v$: Fluid velocity in meters per second ($m/s$)  
- $l$: Hydraulic diameter in meters ($m$)  
- $\rho$: Fluid density in kilograms per cubic meter ($kg/m^3$)  
- $\mu$: Dynamic viscosity of the fluid in Pascal-seconds ($Pa \cdot s$)  


### Supporting Equations

The volumetric flow rate ($Q$) is related to velocity ($v$) and the aperture's cross-sectional area ($A$):

$v = \frac{Q}{A}$

The cross-sectional area of the aperture ($A$) is calculated as:

$A = \frac{\pi \cdot D^2}{4}$




## Experiment Overview
- **Apparatus**:  
  1. A 1-liter screw-cap bottle with apertures of 4mm, 6mm, and 8mm diameter.  
  2. A 500ml measuring cylinder.  
  3. Stopwatch.  

- **Procedure**:  
  1. Water is allowed to flow through apertures under controlled conditions.  
  2. Observations of laminar and turbulent flow are noted.  
  3. Flow rates and times are recorded for analysis.  

## Key Findings
1. **Laminar Flow** was observed for apertures with smaller diameters (4mm and 6mm).  
2. **Turbulent Flow** dominated for larger aperture sizes (8mm).  
3. Experimental results highlight the dependence of the Reynolds number on flow velocity, aperture size, and fluid properties.
